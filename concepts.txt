********************** what is Hadoop daemons ***********************
Daemons in computing terms is a process that runs in the background. Hadoop has five such daemons. 
They are NameNode, Secondary NameNode, DataNode, JobTracker and TaskTracker. Each daemons runs separately in its own JVM. 
We discuss about NameNode, Secondary NameNode and DataNode in this post as they are associated with HDFS.

From the lecture:

A Hadoop cluster is a group of computers working together 
  – Usually runs HDFS and MapReduce
A node is an individual computer in the cluster
  – Master nodes manage distribuMon of work and data to slave nodes
A daemon is a program running on a node
  – Each performs different funcMons in the cluster
